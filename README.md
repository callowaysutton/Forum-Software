# What is this?

This is a very simple forum software created by Calloway Sutton based on DatOneLefty's (on Github) ATC Challenges code.
It allows replying, posting, and viewing others profiles with hopefully more in the future.

I want this software to be very open and be very easily modifiable plus easily readable, this is why you might see the code
leaning more torwards readability rather than functionality.

# How to set up

This is a very easy thing to set up. All you have to do is put the code in an Apache server and create 3 folders** below the
web directory.

** The folders should be a folder below where the first index file is and should be structured like below.
```
          WebRoot
             |
            \ /
            data
             /\
            /  \
           /    \
          \/    \/
         users posts
